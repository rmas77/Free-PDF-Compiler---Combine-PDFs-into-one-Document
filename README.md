Free Locally-Running PDF Combiner - Compile PDFS into 1 Document

 Local PDF Merger

A single-file HTML application that merges multiple PDF files into one. It runs entirely in the browser using JavaScript, so no files are uploaded to any server.

Usage:
Download merger.html.
Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
Drag and drop PDF files into the window, reorder if needed, and click Merge.

Dependencies
pdf-lib: Handles PDF generation.
Tailwind CSS: Handles styling.
Lucide: Handles icons.

All dependencies are loaded via CDN, requiring an internet connection to load the page initially, but processing happens locally.
